- Minimal container architecture:
  - **Frontend:** Static files served by Nginx
  - **Backend:** Single Flask application container
  - **Database:** PostgreSQL container
  - **Reverse Proxy:** Traefik (for automatic SSL and routing)
- Optional Redis container (add only if caching becomes necessary)
- Single-file environment configuration for easy management

### Home Server Infrastructure
- Self-hosted deployment on home server with public IP
- Domain management through Cloudflare DNS
- Multi-domain routing for different applications:
  - Main application: `accommodation.example.com`
  - Alternative subdomain: `schedule.example.com`
  - Admin panel: `admin-accommodation.example.com`

### Reverse Proxy Configuration (Simplified)
**Traefik (Recommended for Simplicity):**
- Automatic SSL certificate generation and renewal
- Simple Docker label-based routing configuration
- Minimal configuration files
- Built-in health checks and automatic service discovery
- Perfect for home server deployment with multiple domains

**Configuration Example:**
```yaml
# Minimal Traefik setup for lightweight deployment
labels:
  - "traefik.http.routers.app.rule=Host(`accommodation.example.com`)"
  - "traefik.http.routers.app.tls.certresolver=letsencrypt"
```

### Domain and SSL Management
- Cloudflare DNS management with programmatic API access
- SSL certificates via Let's Encrypt (automated renewal)
- Cloudflare proxy for additional security and performance
- DDNS updates for dynamic IP management (if required)

### Container Orchestration
```yaml
# Docker Compose structure example:
services:
  frontend:
    build: ./frontend
    labels:
      - "traefik.http.routers.accommodation.rule=Host(`accommodation.example.com`)"
  
  backend:
    build: ./backend
    labels:
      - "traefik.http.routers.api.rule=Host(`api.accommodation.example.com`)"
  
  database:
    image: postgres:15
    
  redis:
    image: redis:7-alpine
    
  traefik:
    image: traefik:v3.0
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "443:443"
```

### Monitoring and Maintenance (Lightweight Approach)
- Basic Docker health checks for service availability
- Simple file-based logging with log rotation
- Daily automated database backups with retention policy
- **Portainer CE** for simple Docker container management via web interface
- Manual container updates with tested rollback procedures
- Essential monitoring only - avoid complex monitoring stacks
